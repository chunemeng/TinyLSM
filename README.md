# SE2322 Course Project: KV Separated LSM Tree

This project is the course project for SE2322, focusing on the implementation of a Log-Structured Merge Tree (LSM Tree)
based key-value (KV) storage system with a focus on KV separation.

The goal of this project is to explore the performance of LSM Tree, particularly in terms of KV data separation and
optimization.
